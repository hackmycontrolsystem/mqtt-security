User Summary

Dumps message traffic from MQTT brokers.

This script establishes a connection to an MQTT broker and subscribes to the requested topics. The default topics have been chosen to receive system information and all messages from other clients. This allows Nmap, to listen to all messages being published by clients to the MQTT broker.
